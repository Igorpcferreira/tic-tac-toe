# 🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe: Can You Defeat the AI? 🕹️

**Welcome to the ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe challenge!**  
This isn't your ordinary tic-tac-toe game. This time, you're up against a **powerful AI opponent** that "thinks" before every move.  
⚠️ **Warning:** Be prepared for a serious challenge — the AI is tough to beat!

## 🚀 **How to Run the Game**

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   npm install

2. **Run the Game**
    ```bash
   npm run dev

3. **Open the Game in Your Browser**
    ```bash
   Once the server is up and running, open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

## 🎮 **How to Play**
Click on an empty cell to place your "X".
The AI will respond with its "O" move.
Alternate turns until one of you wins, or the board is full (draw).
Can you outsmart the AI? 😎

## 🧠 **Why is the AI So Smart?**
The AI uses a strategy similar to the Minimax Algorithm, meaning it evaluates the best possible moves and tries to block your path to victory. You’ll have to be tactically sharp to beat it.

Good luck, and have fun!
